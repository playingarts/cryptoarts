Whenever touched by a social injustice, Garavato puts his illustration and muralism works to serve and support the cause in his own way. That’s how he’s been teaming up with organizations and collectives in Colombia, helping them standing for the rights of the victims after half a century of a national armed conflict. Passionate by the music as much as his art, he’s found a way to mix both by entering the gig poster world creating illustrations in silkscreens for music bands’ official merch, in collaboration with recognized Mexican collective 'Mercadorama'. He then cofounded C.ARTE.Latinoamericano and became an API member (American Poster Institute). To this day, he’s been officially illustrating for the following artists : Iggy Pop, Marky Ramone, Foo Fighters, , Queen Of The Stone Age, Primus, Café Tacuba, Gustavo Santaolalla, Natalia Lafourcade, LosPetitFellas, Café Tacuba...among others.",

I did an Erasmus internship in Valencia at a screen printing studio (Lanevera Ediciones) where I developed my passion for illustration. That same year I moved to Barcelona to become an illustrator and there I did a postgraduate degree at BAU (Barcelona University Design Center). I currently live in Oporto as a freelance illustrator. Through my work as an illustrator you can feel the influence of design and whenever it's possible I try to combine the best of both worlds.

By simply changing the thickness and curvature of the lines, Seymour creates an eye-popping 3D illustration. Each of his work exerts great control over line and symmetry.",

      "Justin Poulter grew up in a quaint seaside town on the outskirts of Cape Town, South Africa where he learnt how to skateboard and ride bikes with his friend Dan.The first time Justin took a liking to typography was at the age of 9, when he rose to the top of his class at forging the Stüssy logo. Being the best at drawing made him a hero at school, which is why, when a boring outing to the whale museum led to his creating a comic book called ‘Whale Bones’, it was met with praise and adoration instead of detention. Having recently moved over, he now lives in London with his home-girl Lucille, with the intention of getting a cat. Clients include: Vans, Hunter, Nike, Coca Cola, Bacardi, Hot Key Books, The South African Reserve Bank, Red Bull, Nedbank, The Webby Awards, Men’s Health Magazine.",

Looking at his illustrations is like peeking into a dream right as the dream-image begins to morph into its still-shapeless reiteration...” - Parallel Planets. “Gruing gothic, gorgeously occult, lines heavy, feeling worn; color limited and bracing when employed, Nikita Kaun’s grainy darks break to soft spells that seem to promise a new and special kind of light.” - thechromaticwatch.com",

Since this time he became modern nomad of everyday life, always on the move between Barcelona and Berlin, Paris and Biarritz. He is in an interdisciplinary journey between illustration and graphic design, two-and three-dimensionality. He believes illustration is no longer bound by the flat format, but very often inspects and develops space. With his projects he tries to build bridges between art and design, where illustration, painting, street & communication all play an important role. Joan illustrates his fantastic animal’s world and characters, holy scenarios filled with symbolism and curious lines and textures. A ritual atmosphere ready to melt with typography and endless traces of organic lines growing fanciful. He currently lives in Barcelona and keeps spreading his world through his studio taking part in art festivals, preparing new exhibitions and collaborating with brands and non corporate organizations.",

These realms build upon love, fear, death, life and lust that I cannot render through words. My interpretations are of only mere sketches to what I cannot describe inside me. Building layer upon layer, obsessing over detail upon detail, my creations come to life after many months of hard work. Through this progression my thoughts and emotions change, and my work will evolve but in the end its core is still intact. This is just me, attempting to communicate myself through pieces that grow more detailed and time consuming as I, myself grow, change, learn and experience our shared course.”",

Im originally from Belarus where I was studying languages but moving to Rome made me explore the other side of myself - being a motion designer. I love working either with 2D or 3D animation and motion design and I also enjoy illustration and cell animation. Currently, I am working in a London studio, but I dedicate a lot of my spare time to experiments in animation and keep learning new skills. People say do what you love in your life and that’s why I am a motion graphic designer.",

He needed a meaning to hes creations, he need purpose, he need some order and organization. Thats when he discovered Graphic Design, and he could finally see the functionality of hes creativity. As a Designer, Ion Lucin solves problems, visual problems. He creates things that are minimalist and rational, less but more, and he does it in an unique and original style, all in 3D, but with 2D and bold look. Ion Lucin doesnt like to limit himself, hes creativity to just creative filed, he likes to explore, invent experiment and conquer new creative fields once he dominates the last one. He is in constant search of new creative projects, new ways to innovate and experiment, in order to create something new and never seen before, but always with hes unique and particular style. He is a designer, all of hes projects are created entirely only by him, he creates the project from concept to finished product. The creative fields he works are, Motion Design and Animation, Graphic Design, Typography, Illustration, Industrial Design, and all these are created entirely in 3D, because he is a 3D generalist.",

Magdiel decided to reveal his work in a series called “A Poster A Day” — releasing one piece of artwork on his Instagram everyday for 365 days. Each day garnered more attention from a global audience, ultimately leading Magdiel to be featured by the New York Times, Cosmopolitan, Entrepreneur, and Awwwards. To date, Magdiel has worked with several brands such as Apple, Nike, Absolute Vodka, MTV, Warner Brothers, etc., and currently has a partnership with Adobe as a design mentor and creative.
