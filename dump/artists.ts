His street art activity brought a fresh fun vibe to his way of perceiving art and the world, and opened doors to many different projects, commissions for advertising agencies, collaborations with galleries in Bucharest, Vienna, Berlin, Copenhagen, Stockholm, New York, Los Angeles, Montreal, Glasgow, Salvador, etc. Going through many different phases and influences, from horror movie posters, street art, comics, Saddo has recently developed his style into more elaborate shapes, with many different influences from Giuseppe Arcimboldo, Bosch, Brueghel, Walton Ford, Henri Rousseau, naturalistic illustrations of plants and animals, Islamic miniatures, pop surrealism, religion, mythology. His latest projects include his first solo-show, “Rise of The Bird People” at Objectos Misturados Gallery in Portugal, the “Coffins” duo-show with Aitch at La Petite Mort Gallery, Ottawa, in 2014, and his second solo-show, “A Stranger in the Garden” at BC Gallery in Berlin.",

    info: "Joan Tarragó is a Barcelona based Illustrator. His career started 10 years ago when he moved to Athens for a school internship. Since this time he became modern nomad of everyday life, always on the move between Barcelona and Berlin, Paris and Biarritz. He is in an interdisciplinary journey between illustration and graphic design, two-and three-dimensionality. He believes illustration is no longer bound by the flat format, but very often inspects and develops space. With his projects he tries to build bridges between art and design, where illustration, painting, street & communication all play an important role. Joan illustrates his fantastic animal’s world and characters, holy scenarios filled with symbolism and curious lines and textures. A ritual atmosphere ready to melt with typography and endless traces of organic lines growing fanciful. He currently lives in Barcelona and keeps spreading his world through his studio taking part in art festivals, preparing new exhibitions and collaborating with brands and non corporate organizations.",

Wooden Toy is not only a publication worth collecting for its design alone, but for its aim to document and highlight emerging and established creatives that have in some way been influenced by contemporary culture, design and art while drawing in the creatives that Timba thinks can be, and are, an influence or inspiration to others.",

These realms build upon love, fear, death, life and lust that I cannot render through words. My interpretations are of only mere sketches to what I cannot describe inside me. Building layer upon layer, obsessing over detail upon detail, my creations come to life after many months of hard work. Through this progression my thoughts and emotions change, and my work will evolve but in the end its core is still intact. This is just me, attempting to communicate myself through pieces that grow more detailed and time consuming as I, myself grow, change, learn and experience our shared course.”",

As a Designer, Ion Lucin solves problems, visual problems. He creates things that are minimalist and rational, less but more, and he does it in an unique and original style, all in 3D, but with 2D and bold look. Ion Lucin doesnt like to limit himself, hes creativity to just creative filed, he likes to explore, invent experiment and conquer new creative fields once he dominates the last one. He is in constant search of new creative projects, new ways to innovate and experiment, in order to create something new and never seen before, but always with hes unique and particular style. He is a designer, all of hes projects are created entirely only by him, he creates the project from concept to finished product. The creative fields he works are, Motion Design and Animation, Graphic Design, Typography, Illustration, Industrial Design, and all these are created entirely in 3D, because he is a 3D generalist.",

Looking for freedom and a better life, Lopez moved to the United States at fifteen, where he continued working on his skill for the next 10 years privately. Magdiel decided to reveal his work in a series called “A Poster A Day” — releasing one piece of artwork on his Instagram everyday for 365 days. Each day garnered more attention from a global audience, ultimately leading Magdiel to be featured by the New York Times, Cosmopolitan, Entrepreneur, and Awwwards. To date, Magdiel has worked with several brands such as Apple, Nike, Absolute Vodka, MTV, Warner Brothers, etc., and currently has a partnership with Adobe as a design mentor and creative. Magdiel lives in Dallas, Texas where he runs his own creative agency, Belmont Creative.",
