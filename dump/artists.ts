He is also the worlds tallest ninja (in his dreams) and has a proper love of all things retro and kitsch. Most commonly though, Timba is known for founding one of the world’s art communities best kept secrets… Wooden Toy Quarterly: the only quarterly boogazine (half book half magazine) to come out once per year, and proud of it! Wooden Toy is not only a publication worth collecting for its design alone, but for its aim to document and highlight emerging and established creatives that have in some way been influenced by contemporary culture, design and art while drawing in the creatives that Timba thinks can be, and are, an influence or inspiration to others.",

These realms build upon love, fear, death, life and lust that I cannot render through words. My interpretations are of only mere sketches to what I cannot describe inside me. Building layer upon layer, obsessing over detail upon detail, my creations come to life after many months of hard work. Through this progression my thoughts and emotions change, and my work will evolve but in the end its core is still intact. This is just me, attempting to communicate myself through pieces that grow more detailed and time consuming as I, myself grow, change, learn and experience our shared course.”",

He needed a meaning to hes creations, he need purpose, he need some order and organization. Thats when he discovered Graphic Design, and he could finally see the functionality of hes creativity. As a Designer, Ion Lucin solves problems, visual problems. He creates things that are minimalist and rational, less but more, and he does it in an unique and original style, all in 3D, but with 2D and bold look. Ion Lucin doesnt like to limit himself, hes creativity to just creative filed, he likes to explore, invent experiment and conquer new creative fields once he dominates the last one. He is in constant search of new creative projects, new ways to innovate and experiment, in order to create something new and never seen before, but always with hes unique and particular style. He is a designer, all of hes projects are created entirely only by him, he creates the project from concept to finished product. The creative fields he works are, Motion Design and Animation, Graphic Design, Typography, Illustration, Industrial Design, and all these are created entirely in 3D, because he is a 3D generalist.",
