Building layer upon layer, obsessing over detail upon detail, my creations come to life after many months of hard work. Through this progression my thoughts and emotions change, and my work will evolve but in the end its core is still intact. This is just me, attempting to communicate myself through pieces that grow more detailed and time consuming as I, myself grow, change, learn and experience our shared course.”",
