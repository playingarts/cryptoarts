# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Playing Arts codebase.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
